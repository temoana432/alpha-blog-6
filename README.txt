So - to get this all going...

1. Only ssh key checkins are permitted on my Mac (not sure how this is configured).
2. So I probably could have copied my public key over to the laptop but in the end I just forked the Ruby On Rails Developer course in my temoana432 account on github and used the public key from the mac. This way I did not have to maintain multiple public keys on my machine one for repos on my temoana432 github account and one for my repos on SMC40Dev account. Not ideal but there you have it. As it turned out I did not have a public key installed on the github account for temoana so I needed to add this (Profile/Settings/SSH and GPG keys/)
